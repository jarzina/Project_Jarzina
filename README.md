# Tox21 Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing and building models using the Tox21 database, which contains toxicity data for thousands of compounds across different biological targets.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory for storing Tox21 datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and experimentation
- `src/`: Source code for data processing and modeling
- `results/`: Directory for storing results and model outputs

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
The Tox21 dataset contains qualitative toxicity measurements for approximately 10,000 compounds on 12 different targets, including nuclear receptors and stress response pathways.
